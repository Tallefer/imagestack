ImageStack -help bidirectionalsimilarity

-bidirectional minimizes bidirectional similarity measure 
based on patchmatch algorithm for acceleration. This is operated
only on the finest scale. The target image is assumed to have
one frame for now.

 arguments [alpha] [numIter] [numIterPM]
  - alpha : weighting between completeness and coherence term. (default: 0.5)
  - numIter : number of iterations performed. (default: 5)
  - numIterPM : number of iterations performed in PatchMatch. (default: 5)
 You can omit some arguments from right to use default values.

Usage: ImageStack -load source.jpg -load target.jpg -bidirectional 0.5 -display
