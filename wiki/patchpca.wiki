ImageStack -help patchpca

-patchpca treats local Gaussian neighbourhoods of pixel values as vectors and
performs pca on them to reduce dimensionality. The resulting vectors are stored
at each pixel over the color channels. The two arguments are the standard
deviation of the Gaussian, and the desired number of output dimensions. Patches
near the edge of the image are not included in the covariance computation, but
are transformed along with the rest of the pixels.

Usage: ImageStack -load a.jpg -patchpca 2 8 -save pca.tmp
